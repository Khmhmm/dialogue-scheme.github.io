# dialogue_scheme

Dialogue scheme editor allows you to create block-schemes of dialogues and save it in JSON.

## How to run

If you want to run it from src, install chrome (it is better to prefer package manager, so that `flutter devices` have to show it)
```
flutter run -d chrome
```

or Win-special

```
flutter run -d edge
```
